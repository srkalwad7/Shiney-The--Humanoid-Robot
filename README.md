# Shiney-The--Humanoid-Robot
"Shiney" is a humanoid robot  Designed to mimic human appearance and behavior, Shiney is capable of basic facial expressions and movements, including walking, dancing, and various hand gestures, making it an engaging and entertaining companion. 

Key Features:

Facial Expressions: Shiney can display basic facial expressions, enhancing its ability to interact socially.
Locomotion: The robot is capable of walking and dancing, demonstrating a range of movements that contribute to its lifelike presence.
Hand Movements: Shiney can perform various hand gestures, adding to its expressive capabilities.

Technical Specifications:

Microcontroller: Built around the ESP32 microcontroller, which manages processing and control operations.
Servomotors: Utilizes MG995 and SG90 servos for precise articulation of limbs and facial expressions.
Servo Controller: Incorporates a PCA9685 controller to manage multiple servo connections simultaneously, ensuring synchronized movements.
Audio Output: Equipped with a PAM8403 amplifier to enhance sound output, enabling verbal communication.
Display: Features an OLED display for visual feedback, such as status updates or simple emotive responses.

Programming and Interaction:

Shiney is programmed using the Arduino IDE, with libraries like Adafruit GFX, Adafruit SSD1306, Adafruit PWM Servo Driver, ESP Async WebServer, and XT_DAC_Audio to control servos, the OLED display, and voice output. The robot can recognize simple commands and respond via synthesized voice, with gestures synchronized to create a more natural interaction experience. 

Limitations and Future Prospects:

The current hardware imposes constraints on real-time processing and advanced AI-based interactions, such as deep learning. Power consumption is also a concern, leading to relatively short operational times before requiring a recharge. Future plans include interfacing Shiney with advanced AI models like ChatGPT to enhance its conversational abilities, potentially expanding its applications in education, customer support, and other areas.
In summary, Shiney represents a significant advancement in robotics, emphasizing its ability to interact with people through expressive movements and communication. With planned enhancements, it holds promise for versatile applications in various fields.
